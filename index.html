                <h3>Warrior</h3>
                <p>Warriors equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks
                    glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to
                    protect their more vulnerable allies. Warriors must carefully master their rage – the power behind
                    their strongest attacks – in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Hunter</h3>
                <p>Hunters battle their foes at a distance, commanding their pets to attack while they nock their arrows
                    and fire their guns. Though their missile weapons are effective at short and long ranges, hunters
                    are also highly mobile. They can evade or restrain their foes to control the arena of battle.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Priest</h3>
                <p>Priests use powerful healing magic to fortify themselves and their allies. They also wield powerful
                    offensive spells from a distance, but can be overwhelmed by enemies due to their physical frailty
                    and minimal armor. Experienced priests carefully balance the use of their offensive powers when
                    tasked with keeping their party alive.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Shaman</h3>
                <p>During combat, shaman place damaging and controlling totems on the ground to maximize their
                    effectiveness while hindering their enemies. Shaman are versatile enough to battle foes up close or
                    at range, but wise shaman choose their avenue of attack based on their enemies’ strengths and
                    weaknesses.</p>

        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Warlock')">

            <div>
                <h3>Warlock</h3>
                <p>Warlocks burn and destroy weakened foes with a combination of crippling illnesses and dark magic.
                    While their demon pets protect and enhance them, warlocks strike at their enemies from a distance.
                    As physically weak spellcasters bereft of heavy armor, cunning warlocks allow their minions to take
                    the brunt of enemy attacks in order to save their own skin.</p>

        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Druid')">

            <div>
                <h3>Druid</h3>
                <p>Druids are versatile combatants, in that they can fulfill nearly every role – healing, tanking, and
                    damage dealing. It’s critical that druids tailor the form they choose to the situation, as each form
                    bears a specific purpose.</p>

        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Paladin')">
            <img src="img/hero/paladin.jpg" alt="paladin">
            <div>
                <h3>Paladin</h3>
                <p>Paladins stand directly in front of their enemies, relying on heavy armor and healing in order to
                    survive incoming attacks. Whether with massive shields or crushing two-handed weapons, Paladins are
                    able to keep claws and swords from their weaker fellows – or they use healing magic to ensure that
                    they remain on their feet.</p>
            </div>
        </a>
        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Rogue')">
            <img src="img/hero/rogue.jpg" alt="rogue">
            <div>
                <h3>Rogue</h3>
                <p>Rogues often initiate combat with a surprise attack from the shadows, leading with vicious melee
                    strikes. When in protracted battles, they utilize a successive combination of carefully chosen
                    attacks to soften the enemy up for a killing blow. Rogues must take special care when selecting
                    targets so that their combo attacks are not wasted, and they must be conscious of when to hide or
                    flee if a battle turns against them.</p>
            </div>

        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Deathknight')">
            <img src="img/hero/deathknight.jpg" alt="deathknight">
            <div>
                <h3>Death Knight</h3>
                <p>Death Knights engage their foes up-close, supplementing swings of their weapons with dark magic that
                    renders enemies vulnerable or damages them with unholy power. They drag foes into one-on-one
                    conflicts, compelling them to focus their attacks away from weaker companions. To prevent their
                    enemies from fleeing their grasp, death knights must remain mindful of the power they call forth
                    from runes, and pace their attacks appropriately.</p>
            </div>
        </a>
        <a href="#" onclick="GameManager.setGameStart('Mage')">
            <img src="img/hero/mage.jpg" alt="mage">
            <div>
                <h3>Mage</h3>
                <p>Mages demolish their foes with arcane incantations. Although they wield powerful offensive spells,
                    mages are fragile and lightly armored, making them particularly vulnerable to close-range attacks.
                    Wise mages make careful use of their spells to keep their foes at a distance or hold them in place.
                </p>

            <img src="img/hero/monk.jpg" alt="monk">
            <div>
                <h3>Monk</h3>
                <p>Whatever their combat role, monks rely mainly on their hands and feet to do the talking, and on
                    strong connection with their inner chi to power their abilities. Abilities such as Expel Harm and
                    Chi Wave both heal their allies while at the same time damaging their enemies.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Demon Hunter</h3>
                <p>Forgoing heavy armor, Demon Hunters capitalize on speed, closing the distance quickly to strike
                    enemies with one-handed weapons. However, Illidari must also use their agility defensively to ensure
                    that battles end favorably.</p>
